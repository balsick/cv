  "summary": ["Software engineer with a master’s degree at Politecnico di Torino in Software Engineering, I started working in 2015 at the age of 22 right after obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering. The company I currently work for provides a software (JPiano®) for managing industrial processes. I have developed technical skills in a wide variety of technologies, spacing from backend to frontend, databases, data analysis, and all that is needed to provide a service to a customer, including technologies related to operating it. What I expect to find in my next job is more challenges: with a baggage like this, I want to exploit my experience and keep feeding my *curiosity*:", "I expect to be able to get farther and farther from an operational position and become a pure designer and decision maker, analyzing the customer and the project's functional and business needs, drawing a route and guiding the team toward the goal."],
